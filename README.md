## React Drum Machine

Hello! My name is Anthony Coffey and this is my React drum kit. I originally built this when I was learning React coming from Vue.js and have recently updated the project to demonstrate my expertise.

I hope you enjoy this simple drum machine I made! Feel free to use this code however you'd like!
